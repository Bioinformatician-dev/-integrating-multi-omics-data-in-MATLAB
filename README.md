# Integrating-multi-omics-data-in-MATLAB

To develop methods for integrating genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data to identify key biological insights and relationships among different omic layers.

 ## Data Collection
Obtain publicly available multi-omics datasets from repositories like GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus) or ArrayExpress.
Example datasets may include paired genomic, RNA-seq, and proteomic data from cancer studies or other diseases.

## Data Preprocessing
Genomics: Process variant calling data (e.g., VCF files) to filter variants and annotate them using tools like ANNOVAR or SnpEff.
Transcriptomics: Normalize RNA-seq data using methods like DESeq2 or edgeR. Convert raw counts to TPM or FPKM for consistency.
Proteomics: Process mass spectrometry data to quantify protein levels, using tools like MaxQuant or Proteome Discoverer. Normalize protein abundance data.

## Data Integration Methods

Matrix Correlation: Calculate correlation matrices for each omic type and identify co-expressed genes/proteins.
Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA): Use CCA to identify relationships between different omic layers and find shared latent variables.
Multi-Omics Factor Analysis (MOFA): Implement MOFA to capture the variance across multiple datasets and identify key factors that explain the data.
Network-based Integration: Construct a multi-layer network (nodes representing genes, proteins, etc.) and integrate data using network analysis techniques.
## Analysis
Differential Analysis: Identify differentially expressed genes and proteins across conditions (e.g., healthy vs. diseased) using appropriate statistical tests.
Pathway Enrichment Analysis: Perform enrichment analysis (e.g., using GSEA or DAVID) to see if differentially expressed genes/proteins are enriched in specific biological pathways.
Clustering: Use clustering algorithms (e.g., k-means, hierarchical clustering) to group samples based on integrated omics data, visualizing results using heatmaps.

## Visualization
Create visualizations to illustrate the relationships between different omic data layers:
Heatmaps for correlation matrices.
Network graphs for integrated data.
Volcano plots for differential analysis results.

## Tools and Libraries in MATLAB
Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox: For statistical analysis and machine learning algorithms.
Bioinformatics Toolbox: For handling genomic and proteomic data.
